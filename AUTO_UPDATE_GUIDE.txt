HOW TO UPDATE OFFSETS (When Tool Stops Working)
================================================

1. Open Unturned (Singleplayer)
2. Open Cheat Engine → Attach to Unturned.exe
3. Take damage → Search Float → Your health
4. Move → Search 3 floats (X, Y, Z)
5. Find address → Right-click → "Find what accesses"
6. Update values in src/main.cpp → namespace offsets
7. Rebuild with BUILD.bat

Done!
